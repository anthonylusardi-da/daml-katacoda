Next we need the MessageEdit component to compose and send messages to our followers. Again we show the entire component here.

First, create a new file in the `ui/src/components`{{open}} folder and name it MessageEdit.tsx. Next copy the code in it and save it.

<pre class="file" data-filename="src/ui/MessageEdit.tsx" data-target="append">
import React from 'react'
import { Form, Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import { Party } from '@daml/types';
import { User } from '@daml.js/create-daml-app';
import { useParty, useLedger } from '@daml/react';

type Props = {
  followers: Party[];
}

/**
 * React component to edit a message to send to a follower.
 */
const MessageEdit: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = ({followers}) =&gt; {
  const sender = useParty();
  const [receiver, setReceiver] = React.useState&lt;string | undefined&gt;();
  const [content, setContent] = React.useState(&quot;&quot;);
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = React.useState(false);
  const ledger = useLedger();

  const submitMessage = async (event: React.FormEvent) =&gt; {
    try {
      event.preventDefault();
      if (receiver === undefined) {
        return;
      }
      setIsSubmitting(true);
      await ledger.exerciseByKey(User.User.SendMessage, receiver, {sender, content});
      setContent(&quot;&quot;);
    } catch (error) {
      alert(`Error sending message:\n${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    &lt;Form onSubmit={submitMessage}&gt;
      &lt;Form.Dropdown
        selection
        className='test-select-message-receiver'
        placeholder=&quot;Select a follower&quot;
        options={followers.map(follower =&gt; ({ key: follower, text: follower, value: follower }))}
        value={receiver}
        onChange={event =&gt; setReceiver(event.currentTarget.textContent ?? undefined)}
      /&gt;
      &lt;Form.Input
        className='test-select-message-content'
        placeholder=&quot;Write a message&quot;
        value={content}
        onChange={event =&gt; setContent(event.currentTarget.value)}
      /&gt;
      &lt;Button
        fluid
        className='test-select-message-send-button'
        type=&quot;submit&quot;
        disabled={isSubmitting || receiver === undefined || content === &quot;&quot;}
        loading={isSubmitting}
        content=&quot;Send&quot;
      /&gt;
    &lt;/Form&gt;
  );
};

export default MessageEdit;
</pre>

You will first notice a Props type near the top of the file with a single following field. A prop in React is an input to a component; in this case a list of users from which to select the message receiver. The prop will be passed down from the MainView component, reusing the work required to query users from the ledger. You can see this following field bound at the start of the MessageEdit component.

We use the React useState hook to get and set the current choices of message receiver and content. The DAML-specific useLedger hook gives us an object we can use to perform ledger operations. The call to ledger.exerciseByKey in sendMessage looks up the User contract with the receiverâ€™s username and exercises SendMessage with the appropriate arguments. The sendMessage wrapper reports potential errors to the user, and submitMessage additionally uses the isSubmitting state to ensure message requests are processed one at a time. The result of a successful call to submitMessage is a new Message contract created on the ledger.

The return value of this component is the React Form element. This contains a dropdown menu to select a receiver from the following, a text field for the message content, and a Send button which triggers submitMessage.

There is again an important point here, in this case about how authorization is enforced. Due to the logic of the SendMessage choice, it is impossible to send a message to a user who is not following us (even if you could somehow access their User contract). The assertion that elem sender following in SendMessage ensures this: no mistake or malice by the UI programmer could breach this.

The goal of the MessageList component is to query all Message contracts where the receiver is the current user, and display their contents and senders in a list. The entire component is shown below.


First, we have created a new empty file *MessageList.tsx* in the *ui/src/components* folder.

Copy the below code into the *MessageList.tsx* file by clicking on the *Copy to Editor* button. Make sure to save the file in order for the changes to take effect.
<pre class="file" data-filename="ui/src/components/MessageList.tsx" data-target="append">
import React from 'react'
import { List, ListItem } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import { User } from '@daml.js/create-daml-app';
import { useStreamQuery } from '@daml/react';

/**
 * React component displaying the list of messages for the current user.
 */
const MessageList: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const messagesResult = useStreamQuery(User.Message);

  return (
    &lt;List relaxed&gt;
      {messagesResult.contracts.map(message =&gt; {
        const {sender, receiver, content} = message.payload;
        return (
          &lt;ListItem
            className='test-select-message-item'
            key={message.contractId}&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;{sender} &amp;rarr; {receiver}:&lt;/strong&gt; {content}
          &lt;/ListItem&gt;
        );
      })}
    &lt;/List&gt;
  );
};

export default MessageList;
</pre>

This is how the code works. First we get the username of the current user with the useParty hook. Then messagesResult gets the stream of all Message contracts where the receiver is our username. The streaming aspect means that we donâ€™t need to reload the page when new messages come in. We extract the payload of every Message contract (the data as opposed to metadata like the contract ID) in messages. The rest of the component simply constructs a React List element with an item for each message.

There is one important point about privacy here. No matter how we write our Message query in the UI code, it is impossible to break the privacy rules given by the DAML model. That is, it is impossible to see a Message contract of which you are not the sender or the receiver (the only parties that can observe the contract). This is a major benefit of writing apps on DAML: the burden of ensuring privacy and authorization is confined to the DAML model.

The UI for messaging will consist of a new Messages panel in addition to the Follow and Network panel. This panel will have two parts:

- A list of messages you’ve received with their senders.
- A form with a dropdown menu for follower selection and a text field for composing the message.
We will implement each part as a React component, which we’ll name MessageList and MessageEdit respectively. Let’s start with the simpler MessageList.

# Katacoda configuration for Daml

This repo contains environment definitions and scenarios for using Daml within
the [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com) learning environment.

# Ensuring that Daml projects used in the scenarios are up to date with the latest Daml SDK version

When using external Daml projects in the scenario (e.g., via a downloaded `.tar` file) make sure that `daml.yaml` file references the Daml SDK version used in the Katacoda environment. You can do that by either

- Creating a new project with `daml new` command and moving the project files into the folder
- By changing the Daml SDK version in the `daml.yaml` file via shell and awk

# Upgrading the Daml SDK version in the Katacoda environment

When upgrading the Daml SDK version in the Katacoda environment make sure to go through all the scenarios and update
the code snippets that are used in the scenario with the appropriate version (mainly daml version in `daml.yaml` file)

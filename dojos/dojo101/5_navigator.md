(covered in [Daml Navigator](https://docs.daml.com/tools/navigator/index.html)) The Navigator is a front-end that you can use to connect to any Daml Ledger and inspect and modify the ledger. You can use it during Daml development to explore the flow and implications of the Daml models.

## Task 7

Once started, you can then open the Navigator at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-7500-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/, and the JSON API at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-7575-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/.

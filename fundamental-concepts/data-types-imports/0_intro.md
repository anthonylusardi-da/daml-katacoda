Choosing the right types for your data will make a big difference for the efficiency, complexity and
clarity of your code. Furthermore, data structures can encode important invariants of your code.
Examples are non-empty lists or optional fields. Daml truly excels when it comes to modeling data.

In this scenario you will learn about

  - basic data types of Daml: functions, records, enumerations, sum types and type synomyms
  - how to import your own modules or the standard library

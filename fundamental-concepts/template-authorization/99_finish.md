In this Katacoda you learned the fundamentals of Daml's authorization system. Now you understand the
semantics of the keywords `Party`, `observer`, `signatory` and `controller`.

I hope I could convince you that these ideas are not as alien as they seem at first by comparing
them to very similar concepts of the UNIX file system permissions.

Daml's authority and privacy rules are enforced on every Daml ledger. This makes it a lot easier to
write secure and privacy respecting applications, because all authorization and privacy logic is in a
single and central place: Your Daml model.

As always, if you have any questions or suggestions, connect with the friendly Daml Community on the
[Daml forum](https://discuss.daml.com).

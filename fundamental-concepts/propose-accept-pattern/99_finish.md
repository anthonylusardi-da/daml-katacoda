This Katacoda scenario introduced you to the **Propose/Accept** pattern. Using the Propose/Accept
pattern is key to creating contracts with multiple signatories. Multi-signatory contracts then allow
you to delegate authority and create **Role** contracts for other parties with the right authority.

Together, the Role contract pattern and the Propose/Accept pattern help you write simple and clear
Daml code.

As usual, if you have questions, comments or suggestions come visit the [Daml

In this scenario you learned

- how to add a key to your template with the `key` keyword
- how to specify who maintains this key with the `maintainer` keyword
- how you can fetch, lookup and exercise contract choices via contract keys instead of their contract ID

Contract keys help you make your Daml models simpler and take the burden of tracking contract ID's
of your clients. So use them whenever you know that a contract field is unique among all created
contracts of a template!

As usual, if you have questions, comments or suggestions come visit the [Daml
forum](https://discuss.daml.com)!

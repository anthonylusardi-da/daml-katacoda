First thing we'll need to do is get our DAML application. In this case we'll be using an example application that's also used in our getting started guide. It's called `create-daml-app` because, well, you can use it as a base for creating DAML apps. Brilliant!

```
daml create-daml-app my-app
```{{execute T1}}


Tests:

```
[[NODE_SUBDOMAIN]]
[[NODE01_SUBDOMAIN]]
[[NODE02_SUBDOMAIN]]

[[NODE_IP]]
[[NODE01_IP]]
[[NODE02_IP]]
```{{execute T1}}

[[NODE_SUBDOMAIN]]
[[NODE01_SUBDOMAIN]]
[[NODE02_SUBDOMAIN]]

[[NODE_IP]]
[[NODE01_IP]]
[[NODE02_IP]]

Congratulations! You migrated all users, posts and comments of your social network while providing
full integrity and transparency on how the migration was done.

Migrating databases from one data schema to another is generally a challenging topic, even more so,
when the database is potentially distributed among several nodes. A Daml application puts the
specification of data and how that data can be changed at the very center. This allows you to extend
that model and prescribe a migration path, all within the same language, without breaking
fundamental properties such as privacy, integrity or transparency.

You learned how to initiate and execute the migration by extending the UI. A different approach
would have been to write a [Daml Trigger](https://docs.daml.com/triggers/index.html) that carries
out the migration in the background, once the user has given their consent by creating a
`MigrateUser` contract.

Please connect with the Daml Community on the [Daml forum](https://discuss.daml.com) and share your
insights, questions and suggestions!
